# React Project Ideas
Ever had a cool idea to an Open Source project but didn't have the time to implement yourself? Let someone else give it a try!

For many working with Open Source, good ideas or cool projects aren't the limiting factor. Time is. But there are a lot of different people out there with various levels of experience and background. Some want to create open source projects, but don't know where to start or what to create. Why don't solve both these problems with the help of each other? 🐦 🐔 💥

This repo tries to collect ideas for Open Source React projects that are up for grabs. It's much better for a project to see the light of day instead of slowly dying in a dusty Reminder-list in some way too small iCloud storage.
